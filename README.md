🎨 NFT_USE_PAYMENTS 🖼️
Introduction
Welcome to NFT_USE_PAYMENTS! This project is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to mint and manage their own non-fungible tokens (NFTs). 🌟

Features
✨ Mint NFTs: Users can create their own unique digital assets by minting NFTs. Each NFT represents ownership of a specific item, such as artwork, collectibles, or virtual real estate. 🖼️

💰 Cost and Limit: Users need to pay a specified cost in Ether (ETH) to mint NFTs. The contract allows customization of the minting cost, and there is a limit on the maximum number of tokens that can be minted in a single transaction. 💸

🔢 Enumeration: The contract supports the enumeration of token IDs, which allows users to easily track and manage their NFTs. They can retrieve a list of token IDs owned by an address. 📋

🌐 Customization: The contract owner has control over various parameters. They can customize the base URI for token metadata, the file extension for token metadata files, the minting cost, and the maximum minting amount. ✏️

🛑 Pause Functionality: The contract owner can pause or resume the minting process if needed. This ensures flexibility and control over the platform's operations. ⏸️

📃 Whitelisting: The contract owner can whitelist specific addresses, exempting them from paying the minting cost. This feature can be useful for special cases or promotions. 📜
